# Bioinformatics Practice
## Project Information
This repository contains a collection of bioinformatics programs written to complete the challenges found on the [Rosalind platform](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/).

Most programs are written in Python, however, occasionally some programs will be in JavaScript.

Programs will usually take an input file/database and output a file with the desired result.
